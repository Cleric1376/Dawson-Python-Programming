Chapter 5, task 1
solved with a While Loop and two lists, the first (alist) contains words, the second(new_list) is empty
each iteration we'll take a random word from the alist, to add in new_list, and delete it from alist
so after all iterations our alist will be empty and condition of While loop will become False
