# Michael Dawson, Chapter 5, task 1
# write a code that will print words from a list in a random order without repeat
# solved with a While Loop

import random

alist = ["jedi", "win", "ordeal", "through", "constant", "training", "and", "peace", "in", "soul"]
new_list = [] # we need a new empty list in which we collect words from the first list

# each iteration we'll take a random word from the alist, to add in new_list, and delete it from alist
# so after 10 iterations our alist will be empty and condition of While loop will become False

while alist:
  i = random.choice(alist)
  new_list.append(i)
  alist.remove(i)

print(new_list)
