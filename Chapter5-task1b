# Michael Dawson, Chapter 5, task 1(second version)
# write a code that will print words from a list in a random order without repeat
# solved with a For Loop, indexing, and an append method feature that adds new item to the end of list

 
import random
 
alist = ["jedi", "win", "ordeal", "through", "constant", "training", "and", "peace", "in", "soul"]

# each iteration we'll make a random number which we intend to use as an index number, then we use append method which
# adds the randomly choosen word from list to the end of list, at the end of the iteration we delete the first randomly
# choosen word, that's why at the begining of new iteration we have the same number of words in the list

for i in range(len(alist)):
  i = random.randrange(len(alist))
  alist.append(alist[i])
  alist.remove(alist[i])

print(alist)
